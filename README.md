🌌 TrustVault Simulation Dashboard
🚀 A fintech payment gateway simulator built to showcase SDET skills for CRED

📋 Overview
TrustVault is a fintech simulation dashboard designed to mimic CRED’s credit card payment system, focusing on transaction processing, risk detection, and scalability under load. With a neon-lit, Sakura-inspired UI, it simulates 1,000 concurrent users using Locust, processes transactions via a Flask backend, and visualizes metrics in real-time with Chart.js. I built this to demonstrate my expertise in automated testing, API validation, and performance optimization—core skills for an SDET Engineer Intern at CRED.
🔑 Key Metrics:

80% transaction success rate under load
Response time: 200-500ms with 1,000 users
100% accuracy in flagging high-risk transactions


🔥 Why I Built This for CRED
CRED’s mission to make credit card payments secure and rewarding inspired me to create TrustVault. As an SDET enthusiast, I wanted to simulate a payment gateway that ensures trust through testing, handling real-world fintech challenges like high traffic and fraud detection. TrustVault is a fintech fortress, ensuring every transaction is a promise kept—just like CRED does for its users.

Note to Recruiters: I submitted my application slightly late (May 18, 2025, 8:31 PM IST) due to unforeseen circumstances. I’m deeply passionate about CRED and believe TrustVault aligns with your mission. Thank you for considering me!


✨ Features
